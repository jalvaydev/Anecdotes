# Anecdotes - WIP

## First React Mini-Project

In this project, I created an app which will display a anecdote and the votes which the anecdote has recieved in order for it to become anecdote of the month (currently it is saving votes per session, this is to be updated). There is a button to recieve another anecdote, and there is also a feedback component which has three buttons to leave three different ratings: good, neutral, or bad. There is then a statistics component which will display the individual scores, as well as averages, and other data.
